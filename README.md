[00:01.87] Believe that
[00:02.02] (Female: How are you doing?)
[00:02.93] Allright
[00:04.52] (Female: So, Eazy, tell me, how was your life as a youngster?)
[00:35.52] 
[00:07.02] One: Eazy-E
[00:12.52] 
[00:07.30] Ruthless, my style as a juvenile
[00:09.41] Ran with a gang, slanged in the meanwhile
[00:11.63] Bankin, I specialized in gankin
[00:14.17] Whites, Mexicans, brothers and others
[00:16.35] Daily, it's all about comin up
[00:18.72] Makin sure no punks are runnin up
[00:20.62] (Eazy E: Because I'm a gangster havin fun)
[00:22.99] Strapped with a gat when I'm walkin through Compton
[00:25.29] Terrible, I never listened to my mother
[00:27.61] It went in one ear, and out the other
[00:29.83] Ran my gang, sold undercover
[00:32.37] Call a girl out a name, yo I ain't no lover
[00:34.36] I'm a pimp, mack daddy, lookin for the dollar
[00:36.79] At thirteen I bought a six-fo' Impala
[00:38.73] Rollin, and runnin from the police
[00:41.18] Brother don't you know you can't trust a thief
[00:43.58] Or thug, convict, hoodlum or criminal
[00:45.47] Leave your car open, gank for your stereo
[00:48.03] Hard and raw, no regard for the law
[00:50.13] (Female: Eazy E, were you ever caught slipping?)
[00:52.24] Hell no! Just trippin off 8-ball
[00:54.47] And girls ain't nothin but female dogs to me
[00:57.15] Bitches! I'm sorry for thatIt's in my nature, I gotta curse
[01:01.80] Out anybody gettin on my nerves
[01:03.98] You get beat, ganked, broke and served
[01:06.13] So... you know who I am
[01:08.47] And if you don't like it, I really don't give a damn
[01:34.47] 
[01:11.70] (Female: Hmm, I see, so you're rather violent?)
[01:14.28] Sometimes
[01:15.48] (Female: Ok, what would be the situation when you so-called "gank" somebody?)
[01:53.98] 
[01:19.62] Two: Eazy-E
[01:25.12] 
[01:19.78] Waitin'... for some people to leave
[01:22.31] I got another trick up my sleeve
[01:24.46] Step with pep to the back of the house
[01:26.15] Looked in... all the lights are out
[01:28.95] Grabbed the door and it's locked, so
[01:30.78] Easily made my way to the window
[01:33.27] Lift it up slow, cause it takes timing
[01:35.65] Looked around, and then I climbed in
[01:38.08] Once inside, I start takin
[01:40.38] Cause you know it's no time for shakin
[01:42.58] Get what you gonna get, front and center
[01:44.94] Or get five years for breakin and enter
[01:47.13] Move quickly, but no runnin
[01:49.18] Shhh, I think somebody's comin
[01:51.56] Hear the front door key, and I flee
[01:53.83] Out the back door with a fist full of jewelry
[01:56.18] Over the wall... don't fall
[01:58.33] Wipe my sweat cause that was a close call
[02:01.17] Gettin ganked by the E is a lesson
[02:03.10] So... is there any more questions?
[02:20.10] 
[02:06.38] (Female: Yes, as a matter of fact, there is...
[02:08.33] Have you ever been involved in, like, a armed robbery or a hold-up?)
[02:11.77] You mean a 211?
[02:12.87] (Female: Yeah)
[02:19.87] 
[02:13.31] Three: Eazy-E
[02:19.81] 
[02:14.50] There's a store, but don't point
[02:16.53] Walk inside, case the joint
[02:18.63] One man behind the counter, another in the back
[02:20.98] Go out to the car and load the gat
[02:23.12] Grabbed the ski mask, here's the task
[02:25.64] Go in broke, come out with cash
[02:27.74] (Female: Were you slick?)
[02:28.44] Yeah, you gotta be cunnin
[02:30.30] Told Ice Cube to leave the car runnin
[02:32.50] Walked in, said: "This is a robbery"
[02:34.89] Didn't need the money, it's just a hobby
[02:37.06] Fill the bag, homeboy, don't lag
[02:39.27] I want money, beer, and a pack of zig-zags
[02:41.84] The man in the back had a camera
[02:43.95] So he came out to test his stamina
[02:46.14] Against Eazy E, but he took one
[02:48.42] Fell to the floor, so I ran
[02:50.58] Back to the bucket, then I said: "Punch it"
[02:52.89] Took the gun, and then dumped it
[02:55.11] I'm not like Robin Hood, cause I want more
[02:57.55] Steal from the rich, hang with the poor
[02:59.71] My pockets are fat, you see, it don't matter to me
[03:02.07] I feel like nobody is badder than me
[03:04.86] (Female: Is all that true?)
[03:05.87] I don't lie
[03:07.07] You see... I'm not mister nice guy
[03:24.07] 
[03:09.53] (Female: Oh, so you're not exactly a role model?)
[03:12.30] Not exactly
[03:13.73] (Female: And for your listeners, what does Eazy think of himself?)
[03:46.73] 
[03:18.31] Eazy-E
[03:20.22] Bad and bold, you can't get with this
[03:22.33] Those that tried, you're on my shit list
[03:24.54] Can't be caught, sought or fought
[03:27.05] Thought, and damn so what?
[03:29.22] Down and dirty from the C.P.T
[03:31.36] N.W.A and Eazy-E
[03:33.99] One more, before we end this session
[03:34.76] (Female: What's your real namely?)
[03:36.79] No more questions!
